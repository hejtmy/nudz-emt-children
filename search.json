So the number 1 in relative accuracy means the best possible performance.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo it looks like increasing number of items decreases performance. The selection seems to be relatively stable, but the object order had more thn half the errors in the 5 items difficulty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nJust to remind, if one location is incorrect, then more locations will be incorrect after that, as the participant will not be able to place the objects correctly. This will overestimate the number of errors in later trials, as the errors are not independent and it is almost impossible to do “just one error” in the order of objects. Selection and placement are independent from one item to another."

    "text": "Error description\nParticipant can make one of four distinct errors:\n\nItem selection error: the participant selected the wrong item when given the option at the beginning of the recollection trial\nIncorrect placement: the participant placed the item in a wrong location\nObject order error: the participant placed the item in a wrong order (different from the order in the instruction)\nLocation order error: the participant placed the item (correct or incorrect) in a possible location, but different from the order in the instruction\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe object order error and location order errors are in our implementation identical, as it is generally true that when participants places the object in a wrong location, they will also place the object in a wrong order. There are other implementations where the object order error is calculated differently, so the two can be exclusive, but in our case the correlation between object order error and location error is 1 (tau = 1.00, z = 12.55, p &lt; .001), so we left only object order error in the analyses\n\nRelative accuracy\nAs there is a difference in the potential number of errors possible at different difficulties (for example, you cannot make four selection mistakes out of three items), we also calculated the relative accuracy (1 - errors/maximum posibble errors). So the number 1 in relative accuracy means the best possible performance. This should allow us to consider the performance across different difficulties."

    "text": "Effect of age on performance\nWe fitted a linear mixed model (estimated using REML and nloptwrap optimizer) to predict relative_correct with age_months and gender (formula: relative_correct ~ age_months * gender). The model included name as random effect (formula: ~1 | name). The model’s total explanatory power is very weak (conditional R2 = 0.02) and the part related to the fixed effects alone (marginal R2) is of 0.01. The model’s intercept, corresponding to age_months = 0 and gender = female, is at 0.76 (95% CI [0.10, 1.43], t(417) = 2.27, p = 0.024). Within this model:\n\nThe effect of age months is statistically non-significant and positive (beta = 3.74e-04, 95% CI [-9.26e-03, 0.01], t(417) = 0.08, p = 0.939; Std. beta = 6.54e-03, 95% CI [-0.16, 0.17])\nThe effect of gender [male] is statistically non-significant and positive (beta = 0.61, 95% CI [-0.23, 1.45], t(417) = 1.43, p = 0.155; Std. beta = 0.12, 95% CI [-0.09, 0.32])\nThe effect of age months × gender [male] is statistically non-significant and negative (beta = -8.20e-03, 95% CI [-0.02, 3.84e-03], t(417) = -1.34, p = 0.181; Std. beta = -0.14, 95% CI [-0.35, 0.07])\n\nStandardized parameters were obtained by fitting the model on a standardized version of the dataset. 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) and p-values were computed using a Wald t-distribution approximation.\nThere is no significant effect of age on the performance in the VR task. No effect of gender or the interaction between the two either.\nale lze dokladovat srovnáním děti vs. dospělí u 5 objektů - různé typy chyb připravit i graf a skupinovou statistiku srovnávající Relative accuracy ukázat i všechny náročnosti? děti 3,4,5, dospělí -5,7,9?"
