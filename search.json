So the number 1 means the maximum number of errors possible at that difficulty.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo it looks like increasing number of items also increases the general error. So children are probably not simply remembering the first three locations or objects, but just not remembering anything much at all. Average relative error for all types of errors is above 40 percent, with the exception of selection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe other very probably explanation is the dependency of the errors. If one location is incorrect, then more locations will be incorrect after that, as the participant will not be able to place the objects correctly. This will overestimate the number of errors, as the errors are not independent."

There seems to be an upward trend for older children to making errors more likely."
