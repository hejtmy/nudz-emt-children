But the effect seems to be limited to men.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe fitted a linear mixed model (estimated using REML and nloptwrap optimizer) to predict relative_correct with age_months, difficulty and error_type (formula: relative_correct ~ age_months + difficulty + error_type).

The model’s total explanatory power is substantial (conditional R2 = 0.35) and the part related to the fixed effects alone (marginal R2) is of 0.30.
