So the number 1 means the maximum number of errors possible at that difficulty.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo it looks like increasing number of items also increases the general error. So children are probably not simply remembering the first three locations or objects, but just not remembering anything much at all. Average relative error for all types of errors is above 30 percent of possible mistakes, with the exception of selection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe other very probably explanation for the increasing number of errors is the inter-dependency of the errors. If one location is incorrect, then more locations will be incorrect after that, as the participant will not be able to place the objects correctly. This will overestimate the number of errors, as the errors are not independent of one anohter."

But this is not significant and the data are heavilly zero inflated (lots of trials with no mistakes) and the errors themselves are independent to make strong conclusions.\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar trend is even for the logistic regression modelling the likelihood of making any error. There seems to be an upward trend for older children to making errors more likely. But again, this result is not significant, and poentailly more driven by some external metric, then age itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThere are a few possible explanations\n\nthe data are missing the time component, so we do not kno how long it actually took the children to answer or how much they moved in the environemnt\nIt is possible, that the researcher might have been more supportive with the younger children\nFinally, it is possible that thje researcher might ahve solved the task for the young children (as is suggested in the thesis, that the reearcher kept helping children unable to control the environment on their own), but this information is missing."
